## Motivation
Museums are a place of wonders and a beautiful collection of ancient remains and archeological findings which are of utmost historical importance.
Museum designers or curators work continuously to improve the visitorsâ€™ experience and all the objects have their story to tell which is in the 
text format most of the time. Not every museum has a guide and not everyone reads the information written near the antique. The important and historic information might go unnoticed.
In order to let everybody understand the artifact, something different and unique should be done.
The best way to create this wow effect is to use the most advanced technologies for our exhibits and displays.
Though AI is yet to reach the masses, to give the flavor of AI to the general public and also to use the goodness of this technology in communicating science, an AI based robot is 
developed to work as a museum guide.

## Introduction:-
A robot is being developed with capabilities to operate and explain physical exhibits through interaction with visitors.
This robot also takes into account other factors like choosing the shortest path, collision detection and hence making the museum tour efficient.
To make the tour user friendly it also uses the concepts of NLP so that the tourists can interact in different languages hence removing the language barrier.
This bot can replace museum guides for explaining different exhibits to the visitors giving them a technologically advanced experience.


## Objectives and Goals:-
* Breaking down language barriers 
* Providing a high-tech welcome - even for children 
* Guiding the visitors with a touch of emotion and surprise 
* Very few people visit museums nowadays, our robot can be a point of attraction to visitors, thus increasing the footprint number.
